Hello, I would like to report that it is currently not possible to re-assign a ZD ticket that came in as a concierge service request to agents in the hotel sub-group.
There are however customers who use that request form for various types of requests, even if they are not for bookings that are done using this service
See this ticket as an example: https://tripclickpro.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/518197 
I was only able to re-assign this to a different agent after changing the request type on the left panel in the Zendesk ticket, but doing so falsifies some statistics on what our customers use to contact support
